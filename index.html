        "I love your striking eyes with your natural eyeliner so much. I’ve never gotten butterflies from eye contact with someone until I met you.",
        "I love when you look at me with not only your eyes, but the rest of your wonderful face. You have such a perfectly perfect face and the combination of your eyes, nose, lips, cheeks, and your little cute chin all come together so well.",
        "I love your soft lips and I love when they kiss me. I love looking at them and I LOVE when you put lip gloss or oil or whatever else on them because then they’re juicy and glistening too.",
        "I love your cheeks and how when you smile, they bunch up and the little lines go from the corner of your mouth to your nosey.",
        "I love when you smile with your teeth because I know when you do, it means you’re so happy you forgot to be conscious of your smile. It’s also the most adorable thing ever.",
        "I love your hair and how it flows all the way down to your back. I love how soft it is and how the layers bunch up and make you look like a mermaid. I love it so much I love it I just want to TOUCH IT OEUHFAEA.",
        "I love your skin and how smooth and soft and sensitive it is. I can’t believe you feel insecure about it because I’m so deeply entranced by it. I love its warmth and how I instantly feel comfortable and safe just from its touch.",
        "I love your boobs (oh no) !!!!!!!! I love that they’re *perfectly* sized and that they have the perfect squishmallow texture. On god I’ll say sorry and do anything if you just whip them out (uh oh).",
        "I love your cute little butt. I love what’s hiding inside lol sorry I’m lying (I’m not lying). I love how it looks in the new Victoria’s Secret undies. I’m gooning sorry I had to.",
        "I love your dainty little hands. I love holding them but I also like it when they touch me. I’m telling you, your hands have this magical ability to calm me down and make me feel butterflies. It’s the best feeling in the world.",
        "I love your voice and how whenever I hear it, I get a warm feeling because I know it’s my bubbas talking to me. It feels so good to be in your presence and when I hear you talking, I know you’re nearby.",
        "I love your hugs. I love how your body wraps mine and every problem in the world evaporates for a second. I feel safe and comfortable and finally at home when I’m wrapped up in your arms. I’ll never say no to an Iniya hug.",
        "I love your laugh. Everyone has a unique laugh and some people have ugly ass laughs but yours isn’t ugly at all. I love how you laugh at dumb shit and sometimes things are so funny, you can’t even tell the story of what happened without breaking down into laughter. I also love making you laugh because seeing you happy is the best feeling on earth.",
        "I love how you approach other people’s issues. You always seem to know what to say when someone’s going through something. You know how to ask questions and make people feel comfortable enough to open up. Then, you’re amazing at helping the person figure out a solution. It’s incredible.",
        "I love your emotional intelligence. You always know how to read the room and say the right thing without making someone feel worthless. You can tell when I’m down and you know how to make me feel better. You make me feel heard and listened to and whenever I need it, you give me a safe space to vent without adding fuel to the fire.",
        "I love how humble you are. Like me, some of our humility comes from our lack of self-confidence, but I genuinely think for someone as amazing as you are, it’d be hard to not glaze yourself at every opportunity.",
        "I love how independent you are. You never need anyone else to help you out - you provide for yourself and you get everything you need done without someone holding your hand. I admire how you can do so much and be so productive without any other outside support.",
        "I love how you don’t let anyone else dictate your sense of style and you dress up in whatever makes you feel happy, comfortable, and beautiful. I think your style is incredible but I admire the way you own whatever you’re wearing no matter what shitters say.",
        "I love how you show me your real self even though it's hard sometimes. I know you have emotional trauma and baggage you’ve learned to get through on your own, but I love that you even let me in on parts of it. I hate when you’re down and in the dumps, but it warms my heart when you trust me enough to share the reason why.",
        "I love how you’re open to trying new things and you’re curious about so much. I’ve never met someone so interested in experiencing thrill and someone so open to going out of their food-eating comfort zone. I love pushing you sometimes, but I also feel like you push me a lot too.",
        "I love how thoughtful you are and you always ALWAYS know what’s going on. Emotionally, I think it’s incredible, but you’re also just a ridiculously good gift giver. That birthday you planned for me was the most anyone’s ever done for a birthday for me and I felt so loved and special.",
        "This is so random, but I love your name. I love the way Iniya flows off my tongue. I think it's funny it also means sweet in Tamil because you are really sweet. You’re the sweetest person ever in every way.",
        "I love how stubborn you are. You never sway the opinions you believe in, no matter what other people say. You can think a certain way about something and if you believe that’s the valid way to see it, you’re gonna stand by that no matter what.",
        "I love your soul. You always want to do the right thing, and I genuinely don’t think you would ever act on a bad thought.",
        "I love how you try so hard to understand and get close to your family.",
        "I love how loyal you are.",
        "I love how you appreciate little things.",
        "I love that you buy me gifts.",
        "I love that you PUT IT IN MY BUTTTTTTT!"
